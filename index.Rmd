The documents of the R-Helpdesk website outline how bachelor students in BMS programs will use R in the courses for Research Methods and Statistics (and beyond). There is no need to learn everything in the RHelpdesk documents 'by heart'. It is mainly a reference guide. The document will be updated when the staff discovers problems in the way students deal with R. 


## How to use this website?

Read until "Installing R and RStudio on your laptop" once before doing anything else with R. Then install R and Rstudio. After that read the rest of "Chapter 1. Introducing R and RStudio".
After this make some of the assignments we created. Use the materials in this reference guide, in case you get stuck. After doing three or four R assignments, read the first chapter again, and skim through the remainder of the website.
Before you start using R in other courses, read through everything again, to re-familiarize yourself with R.
