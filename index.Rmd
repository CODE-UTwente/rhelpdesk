The R-Helpdesk website outline how bachelor students in BMS programs will use R in the courses for Research Methods and Statistics (and beyond). There is no need to learn everything on this website 'by heart'. It is mainly a reference guide. The document will be updated when the staff discovers problems in the way students deal with R. 


## How to use this website?

Chapters can be found using the buttons on top of this page. Read until "Installing R and RStudio on your laptop" on the page "1. Introduction" before doing anything else with R. Then install R and Rstudio. After that read the rest of "1. Introduction". After this make some of the assignments we created. Use the materials in this reference guide, in case you get stuck. After doing three or four R assignments, read the first chapter again, and skim through the remainder of the website. Before you start using R in other courses, read through everything again, to re-familiarize yourself with R.
