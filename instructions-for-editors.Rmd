This page describes how to make changes to the R manual

# Explanation

## Method 1: In the Web Browser
Go the the [rhelpdesk.github.io GitLab Page](https://git.snt.utwente.nl/rhelpdesk/rhelpdesk.utwente.io) and click the button *Web IDE*. Click on the folder *book* to find the book chapters, and make the changes there you would like to make. Once you're done making changes, press *Commit...*. You will see an overview of the changes you made. Please add a description of the changes you made under *Commit Message*. If you have the option, you can pick *Commit to `master` branch* for the change to have effect immediately. If you do not have that option, pick *Create a new branch*. Make sure to tick the *Start a new merge request*. This way a request will be made for your changes to be applied. Someone with more permissions can then approve your change to be applied on the website. Lastly, press the *Commit* button at the bottom. It can take several minutes for changes to take effect on the website.

## Method 2: Using R-Studio
### Set up
You need to set a few things up to be able to change the website using RStudio. This setup only has to be done once.  
First, make sure git is installed. Please follow the instructions at [http://r-bio.github.io/git-installation/](http://r-bio.github.io/git-installation/). Once this is done, you can open RStudio, and click *File -> New Project...*. Pick the *Version Control* option, and then pick *Git*. Under *Repository URL:* fill in `https://git.snt.utwente.nl/rhelpdesk/rhelpdesk.utwente.io.git` and as *Project directory name* pick `rhelpdesk.utwente.io`. Under *Create project as subdirectory of:* you can pick a directory in which you want to save all the files.

### Making changes
To start making changes, open the `rhelpdesk.utwente.io.Rproj` file. In the window in the top-right, go to the *Git* tab. Before making changes, press *Pull*, to update all the files to their most recent versions. After that, you can navigate to the *book* folder in the *Files* tab in the window on the bottom-right, and make the changes there you would like to make, and save the files. Once you're done making changes, press *Commit* in the *Git* tab. Tick the boxes in front of all the files that you have updated. Please add a description of the changes you made under *Commit Message*.
